# ğŸ“š Grade Evaluation in C#

This is a simple **C# program** that determines whether a student has **passed or failed** based on their final grade.

## ğŸš€ How It Works

- The user inputs a **grade** (0-100).  
- If the grade is **70 or higher**, the student **passes**.  
- If the grade is **below 70**, the student **fails**.
